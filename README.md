# Data Engineering Resources

This is just a collection of resources I've used throughout my career for picking up various data engineering and data science tools. It's primarily for me to keep them all organized and documented somewhere, but anyone can use this list if they're wanting to learn more about data engineering or data science.

## Python

- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/#)
- [Scikit-learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
- [Scikit-learn Tutorials](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html)
- [Python Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## R

I've found R to be one of my favorite tools for working with data. It has a bit of a learning curve if you're just starting with it, but it has a lot of packages that now make it easier to work with (see `Tidyverse`).
